# GridLayoutWithStickyCells
This is a custom UICollectionViewLayout that is designed for displaying tabular data - like a spreadsheet.  Optionally you can pin row at the top or the left.

In this example the 2 leftmost columns are always pinned, as well as the first row:
<p align="center">
  <img src="GridScreenShot.jpg" />
</p>
